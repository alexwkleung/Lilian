You can find them in <code>src/utils</code>.<p>Here is how these utilities work (in no particular order):<ol><li><p>Using functions from <a href="https://github.com/alexwkleung/Eva-ST-Util">Eva-ST-Util</a> allows you to work with Markdown, such as <em>manipulating</em> the AST. Also, the string from Markdown -> HTML is used later.<li><p>Extract the frontmatter data for each post and store them into a matrix (2D array).<li><p>Create a data structure involving matrices (i.e., multiple 1x3 matrices) that contain the post data (frontmatter, post content, file names).<li><p>Sort the matrix by date (parsed to milliseconds for comparison) using <strong>an implemented sorting algorithm</strong> (i.e., bubble sort).<li><p>Create HTML template strings (index, posts, post list, etc).<li><p>Make sure generated HTML files are minified using html-minifier-terser. Generated HTML files shouldn't be modified directly.<li><p>Using functions from <a href="https://github.com/alexwkleung/fs-dir">fs-dir</a> allows executing file system operations with ease. Filtering and removing extensions were helpful.</ol><p>In the upcoming updates to Lilian, I plan on refactoring the post util so that it is more efficient. While the parsing speed may not be a concern due to everything done locally, the code is quite inefficient regardless.</ol><article></article></article>
